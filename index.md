Welcome to the project repository for Code In Place AI Evaluation Project. 

Efforts of this project led to the paper:

Aligning Small Language Models for Programming Feedback: Towards Scalable Coding Support in a Massive Global Course

soon to be appeared as part of the proceedings of [SIGCSE TS 2026](https://sigcse2026.sigcse.org/).

# Code In Place

[Code In Place](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/) is a Massive Online Open Course offered to thousands of students globally.

In this project, we trained small language models to provide feedback to students completing their diagnostic exercises. 

## Contributors

We would like to thank all section leaders who toke part in the project.
